# Grafana Frontend React Exercise.

Thanks for taking your time to work on this with us!

## Instructions
> Note: We'll be using this as the base of your virtual on-site technical excercise. The on-site round will build on top of this assessment.

1. Clone this repository to your local.

2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed.

3. To start the project, run `npm start`. This runs the app in the development mode.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

5. The repository comes with built in CSS using `emotions`. Feel free to use a different library if it is easier.

## Requirements

1. Clicking on the button should call fetch last location and display data in a new row in the table.

2. In the table, display a timestamp of the call, and the execution time of each call.

3. At the bottom, display the fastest time, slowest time, and average time

4. `App.tsx` comes with a fake endpoint called `fetchLastLocations`. Please do not modify the file `fetchLastLocations`.

5. Once completed, upload it to a repository and send the repository link back to your recruiter.

## Other things to consider
This exercise was meant as a very basic set up. We've got a few questions for you before you leave. Feel free to add to this read me and let us know here.
1. What can you do to improve it?
  - Store `SortConfig` and `LocationResult` in localstorage to persist on reloads
  - Add pagination after the list gets to a certain length.
  - Server side sorting
  - Mobile UX could use more thought as tables don't display well on smaller screens
2. In the 1-2 hours time frame, what did you do to improve it?
  - Extract the table into a reusable `DataTable` component
  - Create a hook like `useSortedData` for sorting logic
  - Add loading/error states for each row
  - Add sorting for columns
  - Display a clear empty state when no data exists and encourage users to interact
  - Update packages
  - Clean UX
  - Wrote tests
3. Did you find any potential bugs?
  - Original code used setResponse (single object), so every new fetch overwrote previous data instead of appending to the array
